## Update
This was a success and this simple app is hosted here:
```https://deploy-heroky.herokuapp.com/```

## Summary
This started as a simple project to automate deployments to heroku, but now I will also use it for starting simple Travis CI tests that will automatically deploy to heroku if all tests pass.
